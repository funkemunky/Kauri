## Information about this Repository
This project was originally closed source and is now open source. Since I will not be able to commit as much as I used to, I have decided it would be best to
open source Kauri, allowing the community to help. There will be more documentation on how to develop and improved comments by the end of May.

For contributors to the Kauri repository, you retain copyright to the changes you submit, and only the code you submit. Contributing does not grant you as a copyright holder any other parts of the project.
